# Data-Scraping-using-API-and-postman
In this project, web scraping of Walgreen website on results of search using “multivitamin” keyword.
Walgreen website constructed using JavaScript, therefore JavaScript rendering service tools such as Splash or Selenium is needed to be able to scrap data from the site. Walgreen also provides an API which provides another way to scrap the data without using such tools. Postman API platform is used to retrieve data in JSON format. 
Two method were followed to extract data. In first method data cleaning to remove missing records followed by saving the clean dataset. In second method, entire data was saved in “CSV” format and subjected to further manipulation and cleaning process.
